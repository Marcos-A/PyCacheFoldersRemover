# PyCacheFoldersRemover
Remove every "__pycache__" folder with its content from your project.

# Description
PyCacheFoldersRemover deletes every "__pycache__" folder within a given directory.

Use wisely. Remember "__pycache__" files (which will be either .pyc or .pyo files) will make your program start faster,
being recompiled every time your code is modified. "__pycache__" folders will reappear after every execution of your Python code.

# Instructions
Run the code from your target folder or run it including your target directory's full path as an argument.
